------
I hope I can make this a note of learning this book, 
with the fascinating ipython notebook.

R code included here should be almost the same with provided with the book, 
but I may add some additional comments or other related commands.

And also I hope I can rewrite at least some of the code in Stata. 
Though I'm not really a fun of Stata, but I have to admit that 
the commands in Stata is very very simple, compared with R. 
Probably I would only use commands that are ready in Stata, 
instead of writing something new. It's a nightmare to write code in Stata.
Especially compared to [Python](http://www.python.org/), which is my favourite.


So I would like to try to rewrite the R code into python too, if possibe.
But at present it seems that python is not ready for econometrics yet.
I know [statsmodels](https://github.com/statsmodels/statsmodels) 
is meant to cope with statistics in python, but it's not comparable to R yet.  
However, it's easy to run R within python with package rpy, 
so it's not really a problem.
